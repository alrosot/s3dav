/**
 * The PUT request operation is used to add an object to a bucket.
 * The response indicates that the object has been successfully stored.
 * S3 never stores partial objects: if you receive a successful response,
 * then you can be confident that the entire object was stored.
 * If the object already exists in the bucket, the new object overwrites the
 * existing object. S3 orders all of the requests that it receives.
 * it is possible that if you send two requests nearly simultaneously, we will
 * receive them in a different order than they were sent.
 * The last request received is the one which is stored in S3.
 * Note that this means if multiple parties are simultaneously writing to the
 * same object, they may all get a successful response even though only
 * one of them wins in the end. This is because S3 is a distributed system
 * and it may take a few seconds for one part of the system to realize
 * that another part has received an object update.
 * In this release of Amazon S3, there is no ability to lock an object for
 * writing -- such functionality, if required, should be provided
 * at the application layer.
