* FIX: a HEAD request on a XML file has a content-type text/xml and this would trigger
  the reading of the body of the response. Now, we never read the body on HEAD requests.

* NEW: On the Website, there is now a FAQ page. Very limited now, the main
  purpose of this page was to discuss the naming convention used by s3DAV to
  define the keys. This explains also why, for now, you can't see the content
  uploaded by a different tool than s3DAV

* NEW: You can browse the content from your Internet Browser by
  accessing the URL http://127.0.0.1:8070

* NEW: when copying file into your s3 account, the content
  is no more fully stored into memory: it's copied into a file
  which is then mapped into memory.

* FIX: leading and trailing spaces are removed from
  the ids in the AWS account form.

* FIX: when we get content from the S3 repository (object GET)
  the content is fully read in memory before being sent back to the
  webDAV request.
  Now, the InputStream is directly sent back to the initiating webDAV
  request. The connection with S3 is closed when all the data have been
  read from the webDAV request.

* NEW: the version number of s3DAV is displayed on startup

* NEW: in the S3 requests, the USer-Agent is now set to s3DAV/<version number>

* FIX: the server is not working properly when compiled with JDK 1.5 - we get
  a 403 error back from the server.
  The reason is that, when sending a HEAD request, the HttpURLConnection is automatically adding the content type
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded and this breaks the Authorization mechanism.

HEAD /s3dav//build.xml HTTP/1.1\r\n
Authorization: AWS XXX:YYY
Date: Mon, 03 Apr 2006 17:14:32 GMT\r\n
Content-Length: 0\r\n
User-Agent: Java/1.5.0_06\r\n
Host: s3.amazonaws.com\r\n
Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2\r\n
Connection: keep-alive\r\n
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n
\r\n

  Now, when a content-type is not set by the application, we always set the content-type to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  even though there is no content associated to the message.

* RELEASE [2006-03-31] : version 0.2 released
