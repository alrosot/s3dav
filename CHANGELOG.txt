## Changelog
### Release 0.6

* FIX: change the InputStream management.
  s3DAV has now been tested with DAV Explorer
  (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/download.html).
  Thank you Laurian G. for telling me about DAV Explorer.

* NEW: there is now a cache mechanism used to cache the 'HEAD' requests.
  This should improve the performances as a lot of 'HEAD' request are
  done to get the status of the file system.

* FIX: you can now create directories and files with spacs or & in their
  name

* NEW: in the "buckets page", from the "raw listing" link,
  you can now list *all* the objects sored in your bucket.
  You'll see there any object, even those not stored through s3DAV and
  which would then not being 'seen' by the s3DAV file system

* FIX: on webdav delete, returns 200 (OK) instead of 404 is the object
  does not exist. This will fix the problem if you move a directory
  isnide your s3 file system from Windows explorer.

### Release 0.5 (not uploaded under sourceforge)
* FIX: log files were not rotating properly.

### Release 0.4
* NEW: there is a new page in the admin page ( http://127.0.0.1:8070 ) called =Logs Page=.
  This page allows you to see the logs (which are also sent to the standard output)

* NEW: logs are stored in a rotating file located in : =${user.home}/s3dav/log/log{0,1}.txt=

* FIX: in the browse view (HTML), the name are now properly displayed.

* NEW: the logs have been changed in order to help tracking of problems

* FIX: a double encoding when getting the parent URI made impossible to
  create a directory containing a space, if one of the ancestor already had
  a space in its name.

* FIX: a HEAD request on a XML file has a content-type text/xml and this would trigger
  the reading of the body of the response. Now, we never read the body on HEAD requests.

### Release 0.3

* NEW: On the Website, there is now a FAQ page. Very limited now, the main
  purpose of this page was to discuss the naming convention used by s3DAV to
  define the keys. This explains also why, for now, you can't see the content
  uploaded by a different tool than s3DAV

* NEW: You can browse the content from your Internet Browser by
  accessing the URL http://127.0.0.1:8070

* NEW: when copying file into your s3 account, the content
  is no more fully stored into memory: it's copied into a file
  which is then mapped into memory.

* FIX: leading and trailing spaces are removed from
  the ids in the AWS account form.

* FIX: when we get content from the S3 repository (object GET)
  the content is fully read in memory before being sent back to the
  webDAV request.
  Now, the InputStream is directly sent back to the initiating webDAV
  request. The connection with S3 is closed when all the data have been
  read from the webDAV request.

* NEW: the version number of s3DAV is displayed on startup

* NEW: in the S3 requests, the USer-Agent is now set to =s3DAV/<version number>=

* FIX: the server is not working properly when compiled with JDK 1.5 - we get
  a 403 error back from the server.
  The reason is that, when sending a HEAD request, the =HttpURLConnection= class is
  automatically adding the content type =application/x-www-form-urlencoded= and this
  breaks the Authorization mechanism.

  Now, when a content-type is not set by the application, we always set the content-type to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  even though there is no content associated to the message.
