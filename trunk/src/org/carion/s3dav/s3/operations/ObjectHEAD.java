 * The HEAD operation is used to retrieve information about a
 * specific object, without actually fetching the object itself.
 * This is useful if you're only interested in the object metadata,
 * and don't want to waste bandwidth on the object data.
 * A HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on an object.
 * The response is identical to the GET response, except that there is
 * no response body. For details, please see GET Object.
